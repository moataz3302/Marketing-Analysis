# Marketing-Analysis

This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze marketing dataset and optimize budget allocation for sales growth.

The Jupyter notebook performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis and modeling using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Key steps include:

Importing and inspecting the marketing dataset with info on TV, radio, influencers, social media etc.
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Extensive visualization and statistical analysis to extract insights
Building a multiple linear regression model to predict sales
Model evaluation using R-squared, MSE, feature importance etc.
Formulating data-driven recommendations to improve marketing ROI
The linear regression model achieves a high R-squared score, effectively predicting sales from marketing inputs.

Skills demonstrated:

Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical Analysis
Data Visualization
Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
Python programming
This project provides great hands-on experience in using machine learning for marketing analytics and optimization. The techniques can be extended to other datasets as well.

Let me know if you would like me to expand or modify this project description in any way.
